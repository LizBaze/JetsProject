# JetsProject

### Description
This program presents the user with a menu that allows them to navigate a fleet of aircraft. They may view the jets' information, load cargo jets, send the fighters to battle, or commence a spy mission with stealth aircraft. They may also add or remove jets. The initial set of jets is read from a text file and stored in an ArrayList. User provided jets are added to the ArrayList but are not added to the text file. 

### Lessons Learned
- A constructor can call another method in the same class file with needing an instance to do so (e.g. my AirField constructor calls the addJet() method). This is very useful
- Never code while hungry
- Break big projects into manageable pieces


### Technology Used
- Java
- Git
